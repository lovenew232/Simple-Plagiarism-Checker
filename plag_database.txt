Dark spirits are often depicted in mythology, folklore, and supernatural fiction as malevolent or sinister entities associated with darkness, fear, and evil. They are believed to dwell in shadowy realms or haunt desolate places, influencing the physical world by spreading negativity, misfortune, or dread. In many cultures, dark spirits symbolize the darker aspects of human nature—such as anger, hatred, or despair—and are often portrayed as forces that tempt, torment, or possess individuals. While interpretations vary, these spirits usually serve as cautionary figures, representing the consequences of moral weakness or spiritual imbalance. Despite their ominous nature, stories of dark spirits also emphasize the power of light, courage, and faith in overcoming darkness.
